Rice Classification by Tensorflow

The dataset has 75K images including 15K pieces from each rice variety.
Rice, which is among the most widely produced grain products worldwide, has many genetic varieties. These varieties are separated from each other due to some of their features. These are usually features such as texture, shape, and color. With these features that distinguish rice varieties, it is possible to classify and evaluate the quality of seeds. In this study, Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag, which are five different varieties of rice often grown in Turkey, were used.
